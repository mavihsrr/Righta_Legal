## About
An innovative application that leverages advanced AI technology to provide users with comprehensive legal assistance and support. By integrating Google's Gemini language model and a customized AI-powered calling feature, our platform offers a unique blend of information retrieval, community engagement, and real-time assistance.

At the heart of Righta is a Language Model (LM) developed by Google, specifically Gemini, trained on the latest Indian Penal Code (IPC) sourced from a provided PDF document. This LM performs Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to analyze user queries and extract relevant information from the IPC, ensuring accurate and up-to-date legal guidance.

## Features
1. Google Search Integration: Users can input their legal queries into the app, which then utilizes Google Search to gather additional information and context. By combining results from both Google Search and the Indian Penal Code (IPC), users receive a comprehensive understanding of their legal concerns.

2. AI-Powered Calling Feature: Through our AI-powered calling feature, users can request a call and receive instant assistance from our virtual legal assistant. This assistant utilizes the Gemini language model to provide personalized advice and solutions, guiding users through their legal queries in real-time over the phone.

3. Community Engagement: Righta fosters a supportive community environment where users can interact with one another, share experiences, and seek advice. Community forums provide a platform for users to collaborate and support each other in navigating legal complexities.

4. Multilingual Support: Recognizing the diverse linguistic landscape of India, our platform offers multilingual support, ensuring that legal information is accessible to users in their preferred language.
